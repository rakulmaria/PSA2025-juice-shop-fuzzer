## Supervision

### 12-11-25

- No papers to compare, what to do?
  - Still look into papers
  - Baseline: Completely random fuzzing generation
- Code setup done
  - Can make better runner with better outcomes/better oracle
- Report template almost empty, what should the structure of the report be?
  - Template is mainly for format
  - Structure: Introduction, background (SUT and method), methodology (/extending the fuzzer/...), evalution/experiment (with results, unless huge), discussion
  - Related work should be short, if it is even there, maybe keep in introduction, but can be own section
    - Be specific, not just add everything on fuzzing
    - Keep notes on papers, with few sentences on what the papers contain/main points/how relevant it is
  - Background should be written while writing rest, with what is needed for rest of report
  - Consider RQ (2-3, 1 if it is big), they should be in introduction
    - To be answered in paper
